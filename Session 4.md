We defeat the bear with the help of an Elf Ranger Chutes who joins our party.

We arrive at the Afterlife just in time to join the tourney.

I met a man calleed Belfour. Ladia Misreem seems to be either not betting or winning.

There's an hour long circus performance after which Gully goes to speak to the lion tamer. He builds a rapport and is invited to join the tamer later in the evening.

Savvek buys into the tournament and reaches the top 8. He's invited to a meal before the final round and tries to pick up info about Ladia (the top player)

Belfour is also in the top 8 but drunk out of his mind.

Chutes meanwhile has found an area not covered by security, as well as some employee uniforms.

Belton transformed into a rat and was eventually able to sneak into the employee only area where he saw what seemed to be a stressed out accountant in one room and overheard employees complaining about their boss Quentin Togglepocket in another.
