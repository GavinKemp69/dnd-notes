# APPENDIX D: SIEGEBALL

People in every campaign world need some form of
recreational pastime, apart from killing monsters
and going on quests. Siegeball, a fantasy sport which
originated on the /tg/ forums for 3.5 edition, is a
perfect fit. It’s fun, violent, complements all kinds of
characters, and makes clever use of existing game
mechanics.

## THE GAME

Siegeball is a game played between two teams of
five players each. Each team has a tower to defend
from the other team. Players can’t attack the towers
directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball that
can be used to knock the towers down. A team loses
when their tower falls.

## The Arena

The game is played in a walled, rectangular arena.
Normally, this arena is 125 feet long by 45 feet
wide (25 squares by 9 squares), though arenas of all
sizes and shapes exist. Each team’s tower, a 5-footdiameter pillar made of wood or loose stone, is set
up 15 feet from each end of the arena lengthwise.
Towers have 15 hit points and can only be damaged
by the impact of the ball.
At higher tiers of play, the tower has more hit
points, increasing by 20 hit points when the players
reach 5th level (35), 11th level (55), and 17th level
(75).

## The Ball

Central to the game of siegeball is the ball, an
especially dense sphere of solid rubber or wrapped
leather that is pursued by the players. The ball is
astoundingly heavy, and players move it by attacking
it. Though some arenas have players strike the ball
with their hands or feet, players are usually given
specially crafted bats for the tasks. In especially
dangerous arenas, players can be given warhammers
or mauls.

The ball has AC 8 and is immune to poison and
psychic damage. It also has a pool of momentum
points (described as follows), which determines how
fast it is moving

## ATTACKING THE BALL

When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it
in one of the eight cardinal directions. Instead of
dealing damage to the ball on a hit, you give the ball
a number of momentum points equal to half the
damage dealt, rounded down. As the ball moves in
the chosen direction, it subtracts one momentum
point for every 5 feet it moves until it stops. The ball
can collide with walls, players, or towers.

## COLLIDING WITH A WALL

If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an
angle corresponding to its direction and continues to
move until it stops.

## COLLIDING WITH A PLAYER

If you are not prone, you can use your reaction to
hit the ball if it collides with you. To do so, make an
attack roll targeting the ball. While moving, the ball
has a bonus to its AC equal to its current momentum
points. On a hit, roll damage as normal, remove the
ball’s current momentum points, and send it in a new
direction. If you miss, the ball hits you, and you take
damage equal to the ball’s current momentum points
and are knocked prone.
If you don’t use your reaction to stop the ball, it
rolls past you.

## COLLIDING WITH A TOWER

If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to
the tower equal to the ball’s current momentum
points and then stops.

## PLAYING THE GAME

The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the
arena. One player from each team makes an attack
roll against the ball. The player with the higher result
successfully hits the ball. Other players begin in
locations of their choice that are between 10 feet and
30 feet from the ball on their team’s side of the arena.
Players act in initiative order. If preferable, the
GM can choose for the teams to take turns acting,
instead of keeping track of the players individually.
The game ends when a tower is reduced to 0 hit
points.

## Siegeball Actions

In addition to attacking, dodging, shoving, and
dashing, (and occasionally using an item forbidden
by the referees), there are a few special actions that
players of a siegeball game might take.

**BLOCK**

You dig in your heels and hold your ground. You
have advantage on any ability check or saving throw
you make to resist being moved against your will,
and you can use your reaction to attack any ball that
moves within 5 feet of you. Additionally, if the ball
is within 5 feet of you, creatures you choose have
disadvantage on attack rolls against it.

**FOLLOW**

When you take this action, choose a creature you can
see within 10 feet of you. When that creature moves,
you attempt to follow behind it, moving up to your
speed, while remaining the same distance between
yourself and the lead creature for the entire duration
of the movement.

**RETIRE**

When you take this action, you remove yourself from
the field and sit out the rest of the game. This may
be useful to free yourself from danger, but you can
no longer help your team. You can use this action to
retire an unconscious player within 5 feet of you.

**TACKLE**

Performing a tackle is a special variant of shoving
a creature, and can be taken in place of any attack
you make with the Attack action on your turn. You
make a Strength (Athletics) check with advantage
contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses
which check to make). If you succeed, both you and
the target are knocked prone in the target’s space.

**ATTACK A PLAYER(ILLEGALLY)**

In most games, an attack can only be made when
the referee isn’t looking. When you make an attack
against another player, make a Dexterity (Stealth)
check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by
the referee’s passive Perception score (usually 14). On
a success, you attack the player without consequence.
On a failure, you are removed from the game until
the end of your next turn, and reenter the game on a
side of the arena near your tower. Shoving, tackling,
and grappling don’t count as attacks on other players.
