The owner of the Overrated Shrub is "Dirk Langden". In our private room we hear a knock on the door. The gnome messenger passes Gully another key.

An ally of the Golden Vault called [Verity Kye](Verity%20Kye.md) had her winnings stolen. We need to meet her at "The Briney Widow". The casino is called the "Afterlife Casino" and we need to steal the money and a small statue.

Gully uses a disguise kit on "Turge".

Owner of the casino is a Gnome called [[Quentin Togglepocket]]. Steal [[Erinyes statuette]] which he plans to use as a prize and 5000gp.

We have to travel downriver.  

1 potion of animal friendship, 1 potion of growth, 1 potion of waterbreathing.
