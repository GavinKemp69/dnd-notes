We decide to take the tram to "The Briny Widow" to meet "Verity Kye" and give her the money and statuette that we recovered from "The Afterlife Casino". 

We take the tram across the city to the "Gloomshire Quarter". We notice that the city is decorated to celebrate the autumn festival.

We arrive at "The Briny Widow" and have a round of apple cider vinegar. We ask the barkeep to pass on a message to "Verity Kye" and are told that we'll hear back by tomorrow. They also advise us that there is fortune telling, "Siege Ball" this evening is for "pro" teams and plenty to eat a drink.

We decide to go to the fortune teller at the centre of the "Gloomshire Quarter". Flame card (someone seeking vengeance), Path Card Upside down (someone doesn't know what choice to make), Staff Card upside down (We need a staff), Giant upside down (go to a place destroyed by giants), Jester (A great monster is in the way). The fortune teller seems to snap back to reality.

We decide to head to the "Siege Ball" tournament at "The Brendan Byrne Arena". The match when we arrive is "The Advocates (3 devils)" vs "Team Titans (2 trolls)".  The arena is 25 squares by 9 squares. There are 2 10ft pillars at either end. Magic is allowed. You can't kill anyone. In this game you can directly attack your enemy. This is a "Limited game rules" game. Other games may vary. The ball moves double the damage rounded down.
