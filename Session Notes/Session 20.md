[[Turge Ilisteth]] looted the two assassins that we had defeated. Map of sewers and a piece of chalk.
We track [[Elaria Windwhisper]] to the centre of the district. We initially lose her and as we search the square notice that the motes start acting erratically and people seem concerned. We see that [[Elaria Windwhisper]] flees into the building in the centre of the square called [[The Grey Bat]]. 

Four light elementals appear as the rest of the party as [[Belton Ironmoon]] stand watch outside at the door. We defeated the 4 light elementals and a giant elemental appears in the building.
After defeating the big elemental the last small one dissipates. [[Elaria Windwhisper]] rejoins us. The motes continue to act erratically, but the storm that summoned the elementals has subsided.
