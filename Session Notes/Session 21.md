We check out the chalk. It's clearly magical and when we draw with it nothing happens, though the chalk seems untouched. We check on [[Elaria Windwhisper]] and she urges us to take her to the [[Order of Helm]]. As we travel we notice that the motes are heading back to a natural formation as opposed to how they'd been intentionally been organised. Savvek also notices that the buildings made of sand look like they're beginning to crumble.

We arrive at the [[Astral Garrison]] and speak with the [[Order of Helm]]. We tell them we have a witness for [[Verity Kye]]'s case. [[Belton Ironmoon]] explains our theory that the problem with the [[Light Weavers]] could be disastrous. We eventually persuade a guard to take us to the leaders of the city, the  [[Board of Governors]]. A "Big Incredible-Hulk of a man" [[Ahmed Tazi]] asks for proof of what we say. We persuade him to send someone with us to confirm. [[Chip Dadlio]] joins us to confirm what we say which he does after we show him what's happening to the buildings.

[[Chip Dadlio]] takes us to an opulent building [[Aether-Watch Keep]]. We are brought to the [[Board of Governors]] where three of the governors are sat in conversation. After [[Belton Ironmoon]] explains our beliefs of the connection between the return of [[Okkuks]] and the information that we had learned about the a connection the "a place destroyed by giants".
[[Belton Ironmoon]] tries to intimate to the group not to mention the [[Staff of Darid]](?). 

The [[Board of Governors]] say they know of the return of [[Okkuks]] and ask us to take a magical oath that prevents us talking about the information that they divulge to us. We accept and they take us to the chief governor [[Elarion Sunshard]] who offers us drinks that turn out to be sand. The books are very ordered at the top, but at ground level the books are disordered and damaged. He notices the [[Skyblinder Staff]] and the [[Bow of Darid]]. Elarion teleports us back to the pudina tree in the unexplored. We discover 6 more pudina fruit. 

The [[Staff of Darid]] shows ley-lines, the strongest of which leads north. We decide to head to the Giant. We decided to visit the Giant to ask about the place destroyed by giants and then visit [[Fort Enton]].
