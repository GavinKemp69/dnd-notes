We've been hired to do a job by the golden vault. Our handler is [[Meera Raheer]].

Golden Vault- Practical organisation committed to the greater good.

We start in the Overrated Shrub Inn.

Suspicious halfling walks up to Gully and drops an envelope in Gully's music case containing a key.

When we started working with he Golden Vault we were each given small music box with a keyhole, this is how we receive instructions.

Gully brings the envelope to the rest of us and we retire to Gully's private room where Gully gives Turge the key with which he opens his box.

"Egg of Eldritch horror (Murkmire stone) is going to be put on display at the VarkenBluff Museum of natural History, we must retrieve it" 

Savvek and I worked for the Donnel family in retrieving a family pendant. Dr Fingus Donnel discovered the truth of the egg. 

We go to an Inn called the Sage's Quill where we last met the Donnel contact on the previous job.

We went to the museum. Gully met an [[Alda Arkin]] (the curator) as he tried to go up to the attic.

I checked the offices and saw a strange doll in the south most office. I enter the gem room waiting to make my distraction.

Turj and Savvek make there way through and Savvek acts obnoxious outside the gem room.

Gully enters last as the curator makes her speech. 

Heist is succesful (kinda) Sam has the "Egg". Savvek and Belton have been dragged off by security and Greg is still inside the museum.

Turj meets back up with Dr.Donnell, she reminds Turj that the price of 20 gold each for the job and she can't help with freeing Belton and Gully. 

Donnell hands over the 80 gold for the job and recommends checking out Bave and Dusters to train up while awaiting the outcome of Savvek and Beltons legal troubles.

We went to Bave and Duster's, gambled some craps and fought a mock battle against 2 blink dogs and an archer. Belton was downed , but Turj and Savvek cleaned up the enemies and we gained anough experience to level up to 2.
