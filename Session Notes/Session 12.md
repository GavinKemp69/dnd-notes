We accept "Calvin's" quest and head west to the crossroads where the tortle "Galapa" is. He has found a torn piece of cloth that belonged to "Peen Cheese".

The storm that we ran from has severly damaged the tree where we first met "Galapa". We head North from here, it's starting to get late. 

After resting we come across goblin signs that seem to have been left to disrepair. Evidence of a larger camp that has shrunk. There is a structure similar to "Fort Enton"

We see abandoned campfires and temporary shelter around the outside.

It's clear that no one has lived outside the fort here for some time. 

The HobGoblin leader claims that the Kobolds (led by a dragon) have taken Peen and are ordering them to rob and attack for the Kobolds. The Goblins have been massively reduced in number. 

If we help the goblins then they will leave. After agreeing to this, we are ambushed by 5 tieflings who demand the money stolewn from "Quentin Togglepocket".

We defeated the Tieflings and they all appeared to teleport away.
