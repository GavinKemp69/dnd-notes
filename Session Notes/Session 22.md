We start heading to the [[Stone Giant]]. We arrive at night and the giant is there. We explain what is going on in [[Ahili]]. He thanks us for our information about the city. He tells us that 100 years ago the shadow creatures came and overwhelmed the Giant village of [[Uvar]] and the giants destroyed it to try to stop them getting the [[Liar's Jewel]]. 

He tells us of the dangers of travelling to [[Uvar]]. First is an abandoned Dwarven City taken over [[Living Fire]].  Also there's the [[Freaky Dragon]] who is probably the Dragon who was controlling the Kobolds.  

We head to [[Fort Enton]].
