The rest of the party move into the forest. While we rest Chutes's body flies over the waterfall, decapitated and accompanied by a scroll that says "you're next".. He's dead. We bury him. RIP 

We meet a human with a warhammer and shield. His name is [[Hammond Chiez]] who's lost his squire Peen Cheese (the naming convention of squires is to take the last name of their knight)
