We start in the dragon's lair and split the 5500 gold so we each receive 1100. We try to rest in the lair, but are awoken feeling poisend. We decide to head back up the lift to rest. Meeting the 2 goblins we kill "Also Guuilly" the poison dragonish thing. Savvek harvests the dragon/kobold egg shell. Savvek holds onto that. We curl up and have a long rest. (I need to remember to get ingredients for Revivify) As I sleep I see a dream of me atop a mountain pushing shadow demons back with the Skyblinder Staff. It is the Staff of Darrid! 

It allows me to see the ley lines that steer the motes.

I see that there is magic coming from the dragon lair. On the journey to the village we pass the goblins who agree to leave. We also stop at the giant Ennis's house, but they can't help us a lot. He asks that we let him know if we learn anything of the storms then let him know.

We arrive at the village. We ask for a person who has knowledge of magic medicine. "Gaylin Silverbeard" is recommended  as a knowledgeable cleric. We meet Gaylin and he looks over Peen Cheese. He confirm that the magic affecting peen is the same that corrupted the dragon offspring.

We head to meet Calvin Lighthouse. He promises to pay for our nights sleep and introduce us to the Mermerids tomorrow. Hammond plays a hacky sack tournament. 

We wake and are introduced to the Mermerids. On the dock are 2 7ft scaly fish boys. They offer a legally distinct kelp (deepsea cavemud) to rub on yourself that allows you to breath and swim better underwater. They offer to give us one return trip to Aheely. Trips after would cost gold 250 per person.

We check on Peen and he is stabilised. We accept the Mermerid offer to take us back towards Aheely. We surface on the other side of a mangrove forest near to the casino waterfall. They direct us toward Aheely. We travel up to Aheely with no issues.
