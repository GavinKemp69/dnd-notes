A storm of light is behind us, in front the motes swirl in a more organised fashion moving away from the storm.  

We continue and come back to the river and find a pudina tree forming a pavilion. There is a Tortle and next to the Tortle is a staff. Turge hides.

The rest walk up and startle the Tortle "Galapa". He was teleported here hoping to get to another continent. He was teleported from the same place as Hammond, in Aheely. The staff turns out to be his walking stick.

He asks if we've seen a rabbit statue. 

We head east and eventually the light storm catches up.

2 light elementals attack us. We see a cave to the north and head that direction while fighting the elementals.

In the cave is a giant (Ennis). He finishes off the last elemental and we tell him about Daridd and ask him what he knows of Okkuks. He says he's been studying the motes and what is going on. 

He's heard of Okkuks as a legend. We ask what he thinks of Okkuks returning. He thinks whatever is happening is not good.
