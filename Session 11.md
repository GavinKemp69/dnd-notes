We awake in the giants cave and are told to leave. he asks that we let him know if we learn anything about the motes/okkuks. Before we leave, Ennis offers some "Oak Water". 

We head east and see a village. Savvek looks for signs of strangeness from a mile away. Nothing looks out of the ordinary. Village is built up around a river that flows through it.

A large guard tower stands in the centre of the village with walls around the village. Village is "Fort Enton", they oppose the lightbringers (and presumably support the return of Okkuks)

Children are training in combat at school.  The village is clearly a ruined stone village that's been repaired with wood.

This is dwarven stonework that is 10,000 years old. It's so old that it's unrecognisable behond being Dwergar. 

The village is not filled with Mermerids, but occupied by dwarves and humans. We find an inn called the "Oak Iron Lodge". 

Hammond walks up to speak to a man called "Thaddius Stonewall" drinking at the bar. Hammond asks if he knows of the mermerids. He has a teddybear called "Flufferknocks".

Thaddius tells us that the lightbringers went too far and created problems by delving too deep. 

This village trade with Aheely via the mermerids who live in the water outside the village.

We go shopping and buy some weapons. We then visit the tattoo parlour and get nothing.

We head to the warehouse at the docks and ask about the mermerids. They tell us to wait 8 days till the mermerids return. The man at the warehouse "Calvin Lightouse" asks us to find out what happened to the goblins north west of here.
