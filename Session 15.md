Green dragon, we are taken to their cave by the kobold whom I revived with healing word. The kobold said that a shaman opened the dragon's egg. We trake the lift down to the dragon's chamber. They have left taking most of the horde. 

Peen Cheese is locked up and Hammond Runs to him, triggering a suit of armour and 3 gold golems to come to life and knock Hammond unconscious. We attack. We defeat the 3 enemies. There's a gold ring(Ring of Salvation), a suit of chainmail (Armour of Fungal Spores (Heavy)), 

a staff(skyblinder staff), a pair of boots(Boots of striding and Springing). There is 5500 in gold and jewels. There is a flute with a piece of paper. The paper is sheet music. It's titled "The Ballad of Komorebi". Guilly plays it on his barryshaam which turns it into a magical weapon.

We level up to 5!
