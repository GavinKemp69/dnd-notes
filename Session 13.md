We buy a shortbow from the goblins. We decide to attack the Kobold camp. The dragon is potentially stuck in the cave. Gully charms (suggestion) a kobold and lures 3 others into an ambush. We defeat them and push further into

the kobold cave. We spot more kobolds. We defeat one and two run calling for support. We hold our position.
